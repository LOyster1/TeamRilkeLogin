Mysql database setup:

table name:
  - user

table columns name: 
  - first_name
  - last_name
  - email
  - username
  - password
  - id

id is set to AUTO_INCREMENT

The above is the database setup i used for the login/registration. 
The styling and layout for the website can be changed as needed. Mostly i just wanted the site to be functional.

The naming convention and file structure can be changed. I just used the following for continuity sake.

Naming Convention:
  Multi word files should be seperated by a hyphen (-). Only use lowercase characters [a-z], numbers [0-9], and the hyphen character [-] in folder and file names.
  for example:
  - product-launch.doc
  - wedding-reception.jpg
  - name-of-blog.html
  - main-style.css

File Structure:
 - root/css - holds the CSS
 - root/img - holds images or pictues for the site
 - root/script - holds the scripts such as javascript and php
 - root/include - holds the files to be included with a most, if not all, the other pages. For example the header, navbar, footer
